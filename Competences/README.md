# Generic and Specific Competencies

## Generic competences:
During the process, the sprint sessions, both with the tutor's presence and without it, allowed us to improve our oral expression skill for we had to share our individual contribution. We also made use of ICT, for instance: for creation of the repository we used Github; Prototyping: Figma; Presentations: Canva, PPT; likewise, cell phones and laptops were required all the time, as well as social networks to stay in touch with the team. We worked in a friendly environment throughout the second deadline, just as we make decisions cooperatively.

## Specific competence:
This competition was achieved through presentations carried out by our classmates, where each team explained a type of Software Life Cycle Model. After the presentations, it was determined which was best for each type of project. In our case, we make use of the life cycle based on Scrum.
