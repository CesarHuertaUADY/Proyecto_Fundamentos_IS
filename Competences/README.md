# General Competences
### Communicates in Spanish in oral and written form in their professional interventions and in their personal life, using the language correctly
The elaboration of the project forces us to communicate in Spanish correctly, since ideas and things are required to be transmitted correctly. This competence is achieved through meetings and text messages that are held with the team and tutor.

### Use of ICTs in their professional interventions and in their personal lives in a responsible manner
The use of technological tools was extremely important because they are used in the organization, documentation, and development of the entire project. Practically in all the activities carried out this competence was obtained because everything was digital.

### Manage knowledge in their professional interventions and in their personal life in a relevant way
The project helped us to manage all the knowledge in activities such as the presentation of ideas or the elaboration of requirements, because more than learning them by heart, we had to know how to apply them.

### Work with others in multi-, inter- and trans-disciplinary environments in a cooperative manner
From the beginning to the end of the project, each team member has collaborated with totally different people. This competence was obtained mainly in the interface validation part.

### Make decisions in their professional and personal practice, in a responsible manner
In all the activities, decisions had to have been made correctly so that the results were the desired ones.
