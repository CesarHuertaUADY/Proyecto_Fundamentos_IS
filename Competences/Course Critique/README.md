## Course Critique
Overall the course was excellent. The activities carried out and the project served as a lot of learning for what we are going to face in the future as software engineers. One of the things that we liked the most were the talks that were held, without a doubt they were helpful to better understand what we are doing and we learned more about software engineering.
Regarding the teacher, he was a respectful, committed and very accessible person. His way of explaining was quite good and with a lot of attitude. 
For us, all the competencies mentioned in the study plan were achieved thanks to everything done during the course.

One of the things that we would add to the course would be a visual explanation about GitHub, since at the beginning it was difficult for us to do certain things about the project and due to other commitments we forgot to investigate more about the service.

Lastly, it would be very helpful to have general feedback on each deadline in order to improve in the following deadlines and be more clear about the mistakes that were made.
