# Product Evaluation

In the first deadline we defined the product objective, the users/customers, the product contribution, the requirements and their respective specification with user stories. In this second deadline we made certain changes and adjustments to improve them, we started to perform sprints and we also developed a set of low, medium and high fidelity prototypes that had the simulation of a specific task to allow a better validation of the interface and design, validation that was performed with a sample of customers.
