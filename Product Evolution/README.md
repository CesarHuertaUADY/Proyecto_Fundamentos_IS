# Product Evolution

In the first deadline we made all the starting points of the project. To begin with we did a survey in which we obtained the opinions of the people who helped us define the objective, the customers, the first version of the functional and non-functional requirements as well as the user stories. As we progressed with the second deadline all these elements underwent changes, starting with the functional requirements that constantly received modifications in their wording and some of them were eliminated or changed to non-functional requirements, in the first deadline they were divided by user and system requirements and there were 8, in the second deadline this classification was eliminated and there were also 8, the non-functional requirements were 5 in both deadlines but in the second one some are different, on the other hand the user stories also went from 3 to 14 since one was made for each functional and non-functional requirement, on the other hand in the second deadline a diagram of use cases was made and prototypes of the application interfaces were made, these were also evolving and in total 3 were made. Once the prototypes were ready, the first validation of interfaces was done, a sample of customers were given a specific action to perform in a prototype and thus see how is the use and interface of the application. The validation of interfaces was done with prototype number 2 because at the time of validation we had considered that this was the final one but after the last few days the third one appeared and we could not do the validation of that one. Something important also of the changes that arose in the second deadline is that we began to implement the scrum methodology in a more approximate way to the recommended one since we began to make sprints, in total 5 sprints were made with an approximate duration of 1 week. The roles were the same for each sprint, as Scrum Master was Shaden Aguilar as Product Owner Frida Pineda and Arturo Cadena and as Development Team all team members regardless of whether they already occupied another role. In the third deadline everything was refined, in the requirements were eliminated those that did not correspond with the final prototype as well as the user stories based on those requirements, a new function was added to prototype 3 being this the final one so the functional requirements changed again and a new validation of the interface was done in a more personal way through interviews with certain colleagues from the school.
