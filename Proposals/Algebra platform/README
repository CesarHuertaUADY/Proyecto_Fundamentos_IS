It's no surprise that learning Algebra can be a challenging process,
and the best way to overcome this difficulty curve is to actively and repeatedly solve exercises;
this is the best way to memorize the formulas and procedures, in addition to mastering the mental
agility needed to successfully overcome future challenges, both in Algebra and  any other subject
related to math, after all, practice makes perfect. 

However, constantly searching for the exercises you need can be a bit of a hustle, because even
though there is a lot of material on the Internet, it is all scattered up and may not be the exact
difficulty level you are looking for.

It can even happen that the exercises you are practicing with are way too easy for you, maintaining
you stuck in the same layer of complexity without even noticing it, when you could be progressing and
learning further advanced concepts. 

That's why our project is based on a system that will facilitate the learning process by progressively
providing a wide range of exercises with their respective procedure and result, divided by topic and level
of difficulty, resulting in an essential tool for learning and perfecting your math skills, not only being
useful for students, but also for teachers in charge of the subject.
