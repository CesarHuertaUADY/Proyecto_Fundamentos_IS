# Evolution of the requirements
First, we decided that it wasnâ€™t necessary for the user to register to use the app, therefore we deleted the first old functional requirement and writing on the new non-functional requirements that all the users will be granted to use the application without needing an account. Then we saw that the old functional requirements 2, 3, 4, and 5 were too similar, so we decided to put all this information into a new functional requirement. We replaced the old functional requirement number 6 with a new non-functional requirement because the fact that the exercises are available without the need to be connected to the internet is an attribute. Also, we decided that there were going to be 7 videos for each topic and not at the end of each exercise. We got rid of the old non-functional requirement number 1 because we are not going to know if the app is going to be available in the Play Store or in the App Store, the same with the number 3. Finally, we added that in the functional requirements that the system will receive updates and download them automatically, that it will notify the user that it has received an update, as well as the changes included in it and that the application will have a progress bar that will show the progress of each topic and each level . And in the non-functional requirements, we put that the system will allow developers to modify it in the form of updates.
