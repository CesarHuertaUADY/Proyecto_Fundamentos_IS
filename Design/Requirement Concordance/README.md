# Requirement Concordance
Our prototype meets most of the requirements. Some are implicit, such as the unique use of language in Spanish.
The only requirement that was not met was NFR005 since the application has not been developed.

- FR001: The user will be able to choose a basic or intermediate algebra topic available and the level of difficulty of the exercises: 1, 2 or 3.

In the prototypes it can be seen that there are options to choose three different levels in each topic.
- FR002: The system will provide the procedure of each exercise.

The procedures appear complete in the prototypes.

- FR003: The system will provide 7 videos for each available theme.

There are videos on every topic in the app

- FR004: The system will receive updates and download them automatically.
