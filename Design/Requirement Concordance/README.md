# Requirement Concordance
Our prototype meets most of the requirements. Some are implicit, such as the unique use of language in Spanish.
The only requirement that was not met was NFR005 since the application has not been developed.

- FR001: The user will be able to choose a basic or intermediate algebra topic available and the level of difficulty of the exercises: 1, 2 or 3.

In the prototypes you can see that there are several theme options to choose from, as well as three levels of difficulty.

- FR002: The system will provide the procedure of each exercise.

An example of this can be seen in the prototypes as they show an exercise with its respective procedure.

- FR003: The system will provide 7 videos for each available theme.

There are videos on every topic in the app

- FR004: The system will receive updates and download them automatically.

It can be checked that the system downloads the updates automatically.

- FR005: The system will notify the user that it has received an update, as well as the changes included in it-

Prototypes have notifications

- FR006: The system will save and display the user's progress in completing the exercises by level and by topic.

In the prototypes there are bars that indicate the progress of the exercises and levels.

- FR007: The system will automatically mark when an exercise has been opened

 It is shown that when an exercise is opened the color of the numbers changes to gray.
 
 - FR008: The user will be able to mark the exercises already done.
 
 In the prototypes the user will have the option to mark when the exercises are done.
 
 - NFR001: All users will be granted access to use the application without needing an account
 
 In the prototypeS, data is not requested to access.
 
 - NFR002: The application will only be available for use in Spanish language
 
 As mentioned before, this requirement is implicit
 
 - NFR003: The exercises will be available even without an Internet connection
 
 The prototypes do not show that the device is connected since everything is there.
 
 - NFR004: Videos can only be played with internet or mobile data
 
 As the videos are from other platforms, they require an internet connection.
 
 - NFR005: The system will allow developers to modify it in the form of updates
 
 We cannot confirm the match because the app has not been developed.
