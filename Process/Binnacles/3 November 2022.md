## Interfaces and requirements
**Meeting led by:** Arturo Cadena MÃ©ndez

The mentor explained to us in what ways the application can be shaped in terms of interfaces to know if it is in accordance with what the requirements say and also told us that they must carry user stories.

**Pending:**
- Make user stories that have acceptance criteria
- Develop a prototype
- Make the second prototype
