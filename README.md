**Scopes of the project:** 
* **Objective:** Grant students access to a library of algebra exercises as a tool to practice several topics of basic-intermediate algebra. 
* **Expected results:** Planification and desing of the main idea; develop of functional and non-functional requirements; presentation of use case diagram.
* **Project limitations:** Content only available in spanish during the early versions of the project; since the project is aimed to a very specific audience, the optimal use is restricted to this group of people.

# The problem
One of the biggest problems that students face when studying for their exams is that the exercises that appear in the search engines do not usually satisfy their needs: they are too easy, too difficult, they do not include the answer, among others. Even the simple action of searching in the web for the required material takes time that could be directly used for studying the topic of interest. In addition, many students do not have access to the internet at all times, so they may not have the necessary material to study during their free time before a test.

# Our solution
There are many different ways to find exercises on the internet, but with our app it will be more dinamic, striking, easier and more specific the content that the student wants, also there is no app or website where the exercises are divided into different levels and the fact that it is a web application allows us to update the exercises over time.

# Target Audience
