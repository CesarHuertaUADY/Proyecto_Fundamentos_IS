# Work process
To manage the way to carry out this project we used the Scrum methodology as a basis, however we did not follow it in its entirety due to several factors such as the context of our team and certain setbacks that arose along the way.

# Roles scrum:
* **Product Owner:** The Product Owner is in charge of optimizing and maximizing the value of the product, being the person in charge of managing the value flow of the product through the Product Backlog. 

* **Scrum Master:** The Scrum Master has two main roles within the framework: managing the Scrum process and helping to remove impediments that may affect product delivery. In addition, he/she is responsible for mentoring and training, coaching and facilitating meetings and events if necessary.

* **Development team:** The development team usually consists of 3 to 9 professionals who are responsible for developing the product, self-organizing and self-managing to deliver a software increment at the end of the development cycle. It will be in charge of creating a finished increment from the Product Backlog elements selected (Sprint Backlog) during the Sprint Planning.
