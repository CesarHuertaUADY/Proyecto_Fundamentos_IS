# Prioritization

The MoSCow method was used to prioritize requirements and user stories. This method is very agile and integrates very well into the work.
This method is divided into 4:
+ **Must Have:** Features that in case of not having them, the product doens't work.
+ **Should Have:** Very important but not essential features.
+ **Could Have:** Features that could improve the project, but are not very important.
+ **Won't Have:** Features that are not important at the moment, but in the future maybe.
